# ERC-721 Token Extension for Scaffold-ETH 2

This extension introduces an ERC-721 token contract and demonstrates how to interact with it, including minting new tokens and viewing NFTs owned by a specific address.

The ERC-721 Token Standard defines a standard for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), where each token is unique and can represent a wide range of digital assets, including art, collectibles, and more.

The ERC-721 token contract is implemented using the ERC-721 token implementation from OpenZeppelin.
